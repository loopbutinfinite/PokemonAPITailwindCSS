## Pokemon API Project

## Project Description: Created a Pokemon API Challenge that works as a sudo Pokedex from the Pokemon franchise. It calls and utilizes the data from PokeApi, can be found at https://pokeapi.co/. It is limited to Pokemon generations 1-5(ID #s 1-649) and the project has search functionality for the user to search for the pokemon through the Pokemon's ID number or by their name. When a successful search is done, the Pokemon's name, id number, images of the Pokemon's default and shiny form, their elemental types, a in-game location of where the Pokemon can be found, all possible abilities, all possible moves, and the Pokemon's evolution path (if applicable). The project is responsive to various screen sizes and utilizes Tailwind CSS and Flowbite's library of components.
